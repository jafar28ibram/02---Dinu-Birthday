    <div class="cont">
      <p>I appreciate you every day, and I feel really great to have you in my life, dear friend.
People come and go in life; some stay and some leave. But you are someone who has always been there for me and I’ll forever be by your side.
There is nothing in life so precious than a loving and caring friend. God was kind enough to me that he gave me a friend like you! <br>
I can never express my gratitude to you enough for all of your support and assistance throughout my life.
There is always that one loyal friend who will be there for you, regardless of how many friends you have. You are one of them and I adore our friendship so much!
I wish I could show you how important you are to me. All I want in life is you to remain my best friend till my last breath! <br>
You are the only person in the world who knows me better than I know. You give me so much peace and happiness that no one can give me.
I am forever grateful to Lord for sending you into my life. May God bless you.
Love is unstoppable, love is emotional, love is unimaginable, love is desire, love is destiny, but friendship is one percent more than love.
Without you, I’m not sure where my life would be. Our friendship is what I treasure most in the world.
You taught me the meaning of true friendship and I cannot imagine a single day without you, buddy. </p>
</div>
<div class="cont1">
  <p>Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true friends will leave footprints behind. <br>
I wish I could explain to you how valuable you are to me. Having you beside me is one of those things that I wish for the rest of my life! <br>
I really hope you know that I didn’t mean any of what I said. I am really sorry for hurting you with my words. I miss you so much. <br>
Color may fade, the sun may not shine, the moon may not be bright, heartbeats may stop, lives may pass but our friendship I’ll treasure till the day my heart stops.</p>
</div>
<div class="cont2">
  <p>Thank you for always being there for me whenever I need you the most.
I feel relieved knowing I have a shoulder to lean on whenever needed. Thanks for everything.
I can never thank you enough for your constant support and help in every sphere of life. I feel fortunate to have you, my best friend. <br>
We met, it was Luck! We talked, it was a CHANCE! We became friends, it was DESTINY! We are still friends, It is FAITH! We will always be friends. It’s a PROMISE! <br>
You are my guardian angel. I thank life every day for having an amazing gem like your friendship.</p>
